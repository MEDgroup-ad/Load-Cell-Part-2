# Load Cell Part 2
The final sketch to actually weigh something (like a cup of coffee)

Here I explain the code required to configure the Load Cell and how it all comes together in the finished Coffee Cup Coaster project.

In video #31 we were introduced to the Load Cell and here in video 32 we have a finished project as a trivial implementation but which demonstrates the techniques required to calibrate the Load Cell and how then to use it in a Real World Project.

Using the HX711 makes it all very simple and straightforward, especially using the library that I recommend you use in your project. It even has methods to power down the HX711 for use in battery powered devices.

The sketch can be found here in this GitHub.  
(Note: slightly updated, see my comments in the previous video, under the video itself)

Other calibration links can be found here (do step 1 then step 2)
